The music blasts, the set dining table, the arrival of august guests, the awesome gifts, the photo snaps, her precious red-and-white gown, the merry. But time rockets past and dumps her in the future, here. Now… no shopping, no outing, no cards, no ice cream, no candle to blow air-plus-saliva into, no cake to cut into sweet slices. Now none seems to care. It is a solo world, a strange one at that. Today lost its meaning years back, now just like any other Thursday in any other month of any other damn year."

Startled, she takes two steps closer to the table, tries her hand blindly to reach her bag. But heck, it’s not there. Second attempt, the bag is missing still. Wait… is something toying with her sanity?  She is sure she put it here the other time. She keeps turning and turning around and around, seeing only black and black and black darkness and nothing more. And worse, it’s hard to trace her way out without finding the bag housing her torch and phone.  She stands stock-still, frozen to the heavens.A gentle footstep creeps in from the dark. It sounds closer by the seconds. Her heart jumps, racing off-beat. No action no words, a concrete pillar is better than her. Things aren’t foreboding well. What if it’s a ghost or something worse? Her bones soften up like a biscuit dipped in a pool of milk."

Her eyes fail, but in front of her is her Lagos sister, Mary, holding a birthday present. Kola, the cool guy with a dark acne-ridden face emerges from behind the curtains. Junior, her neighbor’s fifteen-year-old crawls out from under the sofa, holding an iPod. From the kitchen, Lizzy, Toyin, and Emma enter the living room with doughnuts and rolls. Tunde surfaces from under the dining table, pulling out a crate of Coke.She stands on the same spot, mouth open wide, too stiff to fall. Tofunmi, the semi-friend from her workplace enters with a cake bearing her name and +1 written on it. Mr. Sam, the electrician living next door, enters with a package on his right and a kit box on his left.Even if she wants to hug Mary tight and cry her shoulders wet till her eyes no longer produces more drops, she can’t. She is way too drained. She slumps backward like a sawn tree and Mary receives her and lays her well on the sofa.As everyone comes around to check if she fainted, to know whether to pour water on her or not, or to just fan her up, she signals with her weak hand for the party to continue while she tries hard to digest the ongoing.A soft music starts playing in the background. When Titi regains her strength, Mary would explain why she masterminded the whole scene, the heart-attack surprise—it is simply her creative attempt at making up for the lost days."


snack_1 = " I had recently been hired into a software company in Bangalore, miles away from home. Not long ago, I had received a wedding invitation from a relative. I had never met them as they were not very close (my uncle’s wife’s sisters’ son to be exact), still I decided to go there. This was one of those wedding-parties in which you are so distantly related that you don’t even know the bride’s & groom’s names, and you check the invitation card for those. Unfortunately, I had forgotten to do that. To make things worse, the board in front of the party-hall (which usually said the bride’s and groom’s names) said “Sharma family welcomes you” instead. \"Great, now I am at someone’s wedding whose name is not even known to me. I said to me \"It was just like any other Indian wedding party. Kids running around & dropping food; the couple exhausted by the countless photographs they had to take with their countless relatives; teenagers being annoyed by people with questions like “ "

snack_2 = "snack or engineer?” etc. Nevertheless, this wedding was different. I finally managed to get a seat. And luckily, a beautiful girl was sitting right next to me." "Hey, I’m Ajay” I said nervously to her, the only girl of my age there. “Hello, I’m Neha” she said politely. Damn, I was surprised she didn’t give me that ‘go-away-you-desperate-nerd’ look. “Do you know Samir?” she asked. I thought “Who is Samir? Probably the groom”. Instead of explaining her the complex relation between me & the groom, I told her “Yes, Samir is my friend”. “Oh, so are you also a civil engineer?” she asked enthusiastically. I said “Yeah, we work together”, trying to cover up my lie. What followed was the longest & the most-amazing conversation I had ever had with a girl, and I liked everything about her. She occasionally brought up Samir’s name though, and I had to lie my way out or change the topic. After some time, I asked “Would you like some"

snack_3 = "” and she happily accepted it. I returned with two "

snack_4 = "s, and saw Neha putting her phone back in her pocket. She said,\"I have to go now. Samir’s flight must be reaching soon\". Confused, I looked at the stage, and saw the groom who was still sitting there. I vaguely said “Samir?” “Samir, My husband, you know him right? He is returning from Mumbai today” she said doubtfully.“Yes, I just..uhm…good bye then” I said, too bewildered to say anything else. “Good bye” she said & left, having no idea how my heart felt like that damn tissue paper which had fallen from the table and stepped over by more than a dozen people. I thought two things right then “(1) Always check the invitation card for names. (2) Screw everything, I have two "
