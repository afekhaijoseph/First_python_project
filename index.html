I had never met them as they were not very close (my uncle’s wife’s sisters’ son to be exact), still I decided to go there. This was one of those wedding-parties in which you are so distantly related that you don’t even know the bride’s & groom’s names, and you check the invitation card for those.

Confused, I looked at the stage, and saw the groom who was still sitting there. I vaguely said “Samir?” “Samir, My husband, you know him right? He is returning from Mumbai today” she said doubtfully.“Yes, I just..uhm…good bye then” I said, too bewildered to say anything else. “Good bye” she said & left, having no idea how my heart felt like that damn tissue paper which had fallen from the table and stepped over by more than a dozen people.
